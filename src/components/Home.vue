		<p>The threat caused by <a href="http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/en/">
		antimicrobial resistance</a> (AMR) is a growing and
		urgent global health problem. Currently, up to 700,000 people globally,
		including 50,000 people in Europe and the USA, die each year due to drug
		resistance in illnesses such as bacterial infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS and
		tuberculosis.</p>
		<p>In 2016, a number of pharmaceutical companies signed two declarations,
		committing to sharing surveillance data to make it accessible to public
		health bodies and healthcare professionals:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="https://amr-review.org/industry-declaration.html">
			Davos declaration</a> (January 2016)</li>
			<li>The <a href="https://www.un.org/pga/71/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2016/09/DGACM_GAEAD_ESCAB-AMR-Draft-Political-Declaration-1616108E.pdf">
			United Nations Global Assembly Declaration</a> (September 2016)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is an accepted need to share data form the global antibiotic
		surveillance studies externally to guide appropriate antibiotic prescription,
		to set up new breakpoints for antibiotics and to encourage wider innovation
		in this area.</p>
		<h2>Wellcome Trust</h2>
		<p>The Wellcome Trust is a global charitable foundation, both politically and
		financially independent. We support scientists and researchers, take on big
		problems, fuel imaginations, and spark debate.</p>

		<h2>ODI</h2>
		<p>The ODI was co-founded in 2012 by the inventor of the web Sir Tim Berners-Lee
		and Artificial Intelligence expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt to advocate for the
		innovative use of open data to affect positive change across the globe.</p>
		<p>It is an independent, non-profit, non-partisan company that has welcomed
		high profile board members including Lastminute.com founder Baroness Martha
		Lane Fox and former European Commissioner Neelie Kroes.</p>
		<p>Situated in London, with an international reach, hundreds of members,
		thousands of people trained, dozens of startups incubated, and a convening
		space based in the heart of London’s thriving Shoreditch area, the ODI invites
		everyone interested in developing with data – whether on an individual,
		organisational or global level – to get in touch.</p>

		<h2>About the initiative</h2>
		<p>This initiative, grant-funded by the Wellcome Trust, will focus on openly
			publishing industry sponsored human antimicrobial surveillance data in order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to improve understanding of resistance trends</li>
			<li>to inform appropriate antibiotic and vaccine use and over time, to help
				increase surveillance capabilities globally.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With the active participation and data from leading pharmaceutical
			organisations, interested research organisations, and direction from the
			Wellcome Trust and The Open Data Institute, the goal is to agree common
			standards and develop a web-based platform for making antimicrobial
			resistance surveillance data openly published.</p>
		<p>Insights and learnings can then be derived which will benefit clinicians,
			global organisations such as the United Nations, the World Health
			Organisation, and wider society.</p>
		<h2>Plan</h2>
		<p>The initiative is structured around the following activities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Workshop of interested parties to develop a plan for common standards
			and a single portal was held in July 2017 in London.</li>
			<li>Three-month research phase that will began in November 2017 - which
			aims to identify all available human antimicrobial surveillance data, to
			assess how openly available these data sets are</li>
			<li>Second workshop held in March 2018 to disseminate the results of the
			research phase and to present the online portal. The outputs of this workshop
			will determine the next stages of the initiative.</li>
		</ul>
