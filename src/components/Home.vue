		<p>The threat caused by antimicrobial resistance
		(AMR) is a growing and urgent global health problem. Currently up to
		700,000 people globally, including 50,000 people in Europe and the USA,
		die each year due to drug resistance in illnesses such as bacterial
		infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.</p>
		<p>In 2016, a number of pharmaceutical companies signed two declarations,
		committing to sharing surveillance data to make it accessible to public
		health bodies and healthcare professionals.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Davos declaration (January 2016)</li>
			<li>The United Nations Global Assembly Declaration (September 2016)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is an accepted need to share data form the global antibiotic
		surveillance studies externally to guide appropriate antibiotic prescription,
		to set up new breakpoints for antibiotics and to encourage wider innovation
		in this area.</p>
		<h2>About the initiative</h2>
		<p>This initiative, grant-funded by the Wellcome Trust, will focus on openly
			publishing industry sponsored human antimicrobial surveillance data in order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to improve understanding of resistance trends</li>
			<li>to inform appropriate antibiotic and vaccine use and over time, to help
				increase surveillance capabilities globally.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With the active participation and data from leading pharmaceutical
			organisations, interested research organisations, and direction from the
			Wellcome Trust and The Open Data Institute, the goal is to agree common
			standards and develop a web-based platform for making antimicrobial
			resistance surveillance data openly published.</p>
		<p>Insights and learnings can then be derived which will benefit clinicians,
			global organisations such as the United Nations, the World Health
			Organisation, and wider society.</p>
